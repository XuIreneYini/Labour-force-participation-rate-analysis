# Review Report
## Overall:
I think she did a great job with her project. 
- I liked the topic of her project and the clearness of the code and analysis.
- She had a clear structure of the project, and her Readme file was very coherent and it summarized the project perfectly.
- Her analysis is very clean and direct with a nice graph, so that is everything that was assigned.
- Her use of git is also very good. The project ha sperfect folder structure.
- I also really liekd how she had a separate section for her findings.

## Reproducibility report:
1. Yes, I could run the analysis.
2. I had to modify the path she set to import in the data, because she used an absolute path and I needed a realtive one.

## Suggested ideas:
- I would use pathlib so the notebook is runnable from any machine, so I would just use this: PROJECT_ROOT = Path.cwd() data_path = PROJECT_ROOT / 'data' / 'raw_data.csv'
- Maybe she can use more specific commit messages.

Overall, I think she did a great job I would give her 13/15 points (remove some for the absolute path).
